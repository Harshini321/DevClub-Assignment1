            <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
                Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
                 <br>However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

                    <h3>HOW IT SPREADS</h3>
                    <p>The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles 
                        when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. 
                        These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.</p>

                    <p>All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time.<br>
                         Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties.<br>
                          However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as<br> how easily it spreads,
                           the associated disease severity,<br> or the performance of vaccines,  
                            or other public health and social measures. </p>

                    <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
                    <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill.
                         Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions.
                         Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
                         Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.
                         Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>

                    <p>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
                        Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose
                        e, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
                        If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
